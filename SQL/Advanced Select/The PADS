Q2:
    Generate the following two result sets:
    1- Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, 
        immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses).
        For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
    2- Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
        There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
        where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
        If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
        Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

-- SOLVE WITH SQL SERVER
    SELECT CONCAT (NAME, '(' , LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1), ')') AS NAME_OCC
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    ORDER BY NAME_OCC;

    SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(OCCUPATION),' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.')
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    GROUP BY OCCUPATION
    ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION;
